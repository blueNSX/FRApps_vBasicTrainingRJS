### 5. Preliminary Informaton
<br>

You will be building a web site which starts with very simple index.<b>html </b>and index.<b>css</b> files.  Your repository will include both of those <b>empty</b> files plus the needed images. If you follow the directions and copy/paste each sections code you will end up with a still simple index.html but a rather complex index.css file.
